Then, theoretically, we should be able to calculate the probability of a review being positive or negative $P(c \\mid w_i) = \\frac{P(c,w_i)}{P(w_i)} = \\frac{P(w_i \\mid c)P(c)}{P(w_i)}$. Taking the independent assumption, $P(w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_n)$ is given by the product of the probabilities of each word in the review $P(w_1)P(w_2)\\dots P(w_n)$ for a given class, so we will compute the products of each classes probabilities of each word in the review and then decide on the class label with the highest probability."

    "Relatively mild performance variation across each split indicates that our classifier may be overfitting. We can combat this be introducing additional priors to our classifier. Consider smoothing: Recognizing that there are a lot of words outside our vocabulary (after all, we filtered those with frequencies < 5), we can estimate $P(w \\mid c)$ as $\\frac{N(w,c) + \\alpha}{N(c) + |V| + \\alpha}$, where $N(w,c)$ is the number of times word $w$ occurs in class $c$, $N(c)$ is the number of reviews in class $c$, and $V$ is the total number of words in the vocabulary. This formula sort of compromises between total frequentist assumption for observed events (words in the corpus) $P(w \\mid c) = \\frac{N(w,c)}{N(c)}$ and the Bayesian assumption on unobserved ones (words not in the training set) $P(w \\mid c) = \\frac{\\alpha}{|V| + \\alpha}$. It should make our classifier more robust to unseen words while retaining the ability to distinguish between positive and negative reviews. I'm going to start with $\\alpha=1$, but we can tune this value later. Let's see it in code:"

    "[Bayes and Naive Bayes Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0933.pdf)\n",
    "> The Bayesian Classification represents a supervised learning method as well as a statistical method for classification. Assumes an underlying probabilistic model and it allows us to capture uncertainty about the model in a principled way by determining probabilities of the outcomes. This Classification is named after Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), who proposed the Bayes Theorem. Bayesian classification provides practical learning algorithms and prior knowledge and observed data can be combined. Bayesian Classification provides a useful perspective for understanding and evaluating many learning algorithms. It calculates explicit probabilities for hypothesis and it is robust to noise in input data. In statistical classification the Bayes classifier minimises the probability of misclassification. That was a visual intuition for a simple case of the Bayes classifier, also called: 1)Idiot Bayes 2)Naive Bayes 3)Simple Bayes\n",

    "[Modeling Spammer Behavior: Naïve Bayes vs. Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3282)\n",
    "> Addressing the problem of spam emails in the Internet, this paper presents a comparative study on Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based modeling of spammer behavior. Keyword-based spam email filtering techniques fall short to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes tactics to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are themselves patterns that can be modeled to combat spam. It has been observed that both Naïve Bayes and ANN are best suitable for modeling spammer common patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that both of them achieve a promising detection rate of around 92%, which is considerably an improvement of performance compared to the keyword-based contemporary filtering approaches.\n",

    "[On Resource-Efficient Bayesian Network Classifiers and Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11773)\n",
    "> We present two methods to reduce the complexity of Bayesian network (BN) classifiers. First, we introduce quantization-aware training using the straight-through gradient estimator to quantize the parameters of BNs to few bits. Second, we extend a recently proposed differentiable tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) structure learning approach by also considering the model size. Both methods are motivated by recent developments in the deep learning community, and they provide effective means to trade off between model size and prediction accuracy, which is demonstrated in extensive experiments. Furthermore, we contrast quantized BN classifiers with quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) for small-scale scenarios which have hardly been investigated in the literature. We show Pareto optimal models with respect to model size, number of operations, and test error and find that both model classes are viable options."
