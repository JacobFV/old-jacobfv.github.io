Patterns origonally termed ‚ÄòAI‚Äô are unconsciously programmed into codebases across GitHub. Expert systems automate innumerably-many business processes. Hundred-billion-parameter language models generate indistinguishably-plausible written content. Deep reinforcement learning agents have even gone on to achieve superhuman-level performance. Problems, when properly framed, are ripe fruit for AI to master.</p> <p>Yet AI has one Problem to tackle: its own evolution. AI is largely unaware of this problem and the presently essential driving role that the human mind plays in solving it (and usually only after the proding of economics or acedemia). If AI is to approach and surpass that rate-limiting bar of human research and development, it needs to hunt for its own data, write its own code, provide for its own economic needs, and independantly identify and work at its problems of its own interest. Stated concisely, it‚Äôs time for AI to grow up.</p> <p>This demands a complete overhaul to our SOTA-competition-culture, but rather than discarding all the precious information and algorithms we‚Äôve acquired, it needs to all be blended togethor until we arrive at a kitchen-sink-smoothie. That is, there‚Äôs more than enough intelligence baked across open-source repositories on Github, ML models on Huggingface, and API endpoints on the Internet to demonstrate human-level intelligence on scattered problems; we just need to unify those heterogenous pieces.</p> <p>To this end, I am cultivating an open-source ecosystem: the Fertile Creasent. This project of projects is tailored to maximize the synergy between minds and machines, uniting the waterfall of past and present human intelligence, and giving birth to a new generation of fully autonomous, Internet-scale decentralized artificial superintelligence. The ecosystem introduces the new class of <em>hybrid programming languages</em> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutt</code>, a fusion of Python, nodejs, natural languages, and developer extensions. Another subproject, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unsupervised</code>, introduces a set of abstractions and a framework for <em>un</em>supervised <em>deep</em> learning. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TensorCode</code> does the same for Programming 2.0 ‚Äî programming where developers freely mix deep learning primitives with structured programming statements. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deep-Tree</code> extends TensorCode to provide intelligent runtime code generation, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalities</code> and the Multi-Agent Network, aka, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAN</code>, extend these into a versatile meta-learning network of experts composed of pretrained and learning agents. Training abstractions are also included: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-experience</code> is a library to facilitate training and evaluating models, optimizers, pipelines, and training paradigms across dozens of tasks, domains, dataset loaders, environments, and hubs simultaneously, lifelong, and in-context along with a conglomerate environment-of-all-known-environments (datasets are environments); <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-school</code> is a high level education system for training human-level artificial intelligence in the domain of abstract concepts like science, engineering, and ethics; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computer-env</code> is a gym-style environment for developing machine learning agents that interact with a computer which may connect to the Internet.[^4][: The Fertile Creasent includes many smaller subprojects that cannot be enumerated here for sake of brevity.]</p> <p>Integrating several of the above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computatrum</code> is an artificial general intelligence that interacts with any number of Internet-connected computers using the same high-level interfaces as humans (mouse, keyboard, display, etc.). The Massive Multi-Agent Network (Massive MAN) is a distributed, decentralized, democratic artificial superintelligence. From a user‚Äôs perspective, it behaves like a distributed web service which directly links resource holders (algorithms, compute, data, storage) with consumers while also giving providers fine-grained control over how their resources are consumed. Resources are heterogenous and include algorithms (computer code, parameter checkpoints, natural language descriptions / instructions), compute (running hosted containers, executing web assembly / javascript, or providing remote interpretter REPL‚Äôs for Python, node, etc.), data (datasets, environments), storage (fast and slow access), and other API endpoints. Under the hood, the Massive MAN includes a decentralized orchestrator subnet which orchestrates supply and demand, rewards public benefactors (eg, suppliers who release the checkpoint of a valuable large language model) with newly-minted tokens, and records transactions on a blockchain ledger.</p> <p>Then too, why cage AI in the virtual realm? The Internet and its connected social media, survailence, and robot systems give the Massive MAN some freedom, but nowhere enough to rapidly and flexibly interact on the human-relevant scale. The Limboid is an affordable (&lt;$250), maker-friendly family of robots composed of modular bones, joints, artificial muscles, soft valves, pumps, batteries, sensors, and other off-the-shelf components. Modularity enables the Limboid to be assembled in various morphologies including a humanoid (HumanBoid), quadruped (PackBoid), 8-legged robot (OctoBoid), wheeled robot (AutoBoid), and fish-like robot (AquaBoid) as well as individual arms, hands, and DIY mashup creations. Finally, the BoidNet is a distributed network of Limboids providing on-demand labor for agents in the Massive MAN.</p> <p>Aiming the Fertile Cresent such revolutionary technological objectives, I take their social and economic impact as well as safety, security, interpretability, explainability, autonomy, responsibility, and the like very seriously: by integrating a variety of past and present research and development in this project, I aim to align the world‚Äôs human and artificial intelligence with minimized economic, technical, and carbon-footprint cost, by architectuing the Massive MAN as a distributed, decentralized, democratic web service, I align the interests of diverse stakeholders towards accelerating the growth of artificial superintelligence, increase utilization efficiency of present computation resources, and mitigate problems arising from a single AI superpower; by initially adhering to a one-Limboid-per-customer rule, I slow the labor replacement problems it creates; and by performing all my research and development in the open along with actively invinting others to particapate in cultivating the Fertile Cresent, I minimize contributing to social, economic, and skill divide.</p> <p>Industry-shaping developments are ahead and AI is hanging 10. With the Fertile Cresent project of projects, I aim to integrate the intellectual labors of innumerable researchers, developers, and engineers and germinate the growth of fully autonomous artificial super-intelligence, perhaps retrospectively, a significant technological achievement in human history.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> ¬© Copyright 2022 Jacob F.
