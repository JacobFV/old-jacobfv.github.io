I’m a machine learning engineer, roboticist, and entreprenuer at my startup, Limboid LLC, where I work to develop artificial general intelligence and affordable humanoid robots. During the day, I work as a software engineering intern at Motio Inc. I’m currently in a senior at the University of Texas at Arlington working towards my bachelor’s degree in computer science. I love open source work, artificial intelligence, and robotics. When I’m not interacting with artificial agents, you’ll find me working with real people. I hope that includes you!&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>Focus Statement</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;The endless evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) penetrates nearly every esearch discipline, engineering domain, and human endeavor. Patterns origonally termed ‘AI’ are unconsciously programmed into codebases across GitHub. Expert systems automate innumerably-many business processes. Hundred-billion-parameter language models generate indistinguishably-plausible written content. Deep reinforcement learning agents have even gone on to achieve superhuman-level performance. Problems, when properly framed, are ripe fruit for AI to master.&lt;/p&gt;</a></p> <p>Yet AI has one Problem to tackle: its own evolution. AI is largely unaware of this problem and the presently essential driving role that the human mind plays in solving it (and usually only after the proding of economics or acedemia). If AI is to approach and surpass that rate-limiting bar of human research and development, it needs to hunt for its own data, write its own code, provide for its own economic needs, and independantly identify and work at its problems of its own interest. Stated concisely, it’s time for AI to grow up.</p> <p>This demands a complete overhaul to our SOTA-competition-culture, but rather than discarding all the precious information and algorithms we’ve acquired, it needs to all be blended togethor until we arrive at a kitchen-sink-smoothie. That is, there’s more than enough intelligence baked across open-source repositories on Github, ML models on Huggingface, and API endpoints on the Internet to demonstrate human-level intelligence on scattered problems; we just need to unify those heterogenous pieces.</p> <p>To this end, I am cultivating an open-source ecosystem: the Fertile Creasent. This project of projects is tailored to maximize the synergy between minds and machines, uniting the waterfall of past and present human intelligence, and giving birth to a new generation of fully autonomous, Internet-scale decentralized artificial superintelligence. The ecosystem introduces the new class of <em>hybrid programming languages</em> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutt</code>, a fusion of Python, nodejs, natural languages, and developer extensions. Another subproject, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unsupervised</code>, introduces a set of abstractions and a framework for <em>un</em>supervised <em>deep</em> learning. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TensorCode</code> does the same for Programming 2.0 — programming where developers freely mix deep learning primitives with structured programming statements. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deep-Tree</code> extends TensorCode to provide intelligent runtime code generation, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalities</code> and the Multi-Agent Network, aka, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAN</code>, extend these into a versatile meta-learning network of experts composed of pretrained and learning agents. Training abstractions are also included: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-experience</code> is a library to facilitate training and evaluating models, optimizers, pipelines, and training paradigms across dozens of tasks, domains, dataset loaders, environments, and hubs simultaneously, lifelong, and in-context along with a conglomerate environment-of-all-known-environments (datasets are environments); <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-school</code> is a high level education system for training human-level artificial intelligence in the domain of abstract concepts like science, engineering, and ethics; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computer-env</code> is a gym-style environment for developing machine learning agents that interact with a computer which may connect to the Internet.[^4][: The Fertile Creasent includes many smaller subprojects that cannot be enumerated here for sake of brevity.]</p> <p>Integrating several of the above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computatrum</code> is an artificial general intelligence that interacts with any number of Internet-connected computers using the same high-level interfaces as humans (mouse, keyboard, display, etc.). The Massive Multi-Agent Network (Massive MAN) is a distributed, decentralized, democratic artificial superintelligence. From a user’s perspective, it behaves like a distributed web service which directly links resource holders (algorithms, compute, data, storage) with consumers while also giving providers fine-grained control over how their resources are consumed. Resources are heterogenous and include algorithms (computer code, parameter checkpoints, natural language descriptions / instructions), compute (running hosted containers, executing web assembly / javascript, or providing remote interpretter REPL’s for Python, node, etc.), data (datasets, environments), storage (fast and slow access), and other API endpoints. Under the hood, the Massive MAN includes a decentralized orchestrator subnet which orchestrates supply and demand, rewards public benefactors (eg, suppliers who release the checkpoint of a valuable large language model) with newly-minted tokens, and records transactions on a blockchain ledger.</p> <p>Then too, why cage AI in the virtual realm? The Internet and its connected social media, survailence, and robot systems give the Massive MAN some freedom, but nowhere enough to rapidly and flexibly interact on the human-relevant scale. The Limboid is an affordable (&lt;$250), maker-friendly family of robots composed of modular bones, joints, artificial muscles, soft valves, pumps, batteries, sensors, and other off-the-shelf components. Modularity enables the Limboid to be assembled in various morphologies including a humanoid (HumanBoid), quadruped (PackBoid), 8-legged robot (OctoBoid), wheeled robot (AutoBoid), and fish-like robot (AquaBoid) as well as individual arms, hands, and DIY mashup creations. Finally, the BoidNet is a distributed network of Limboids providing on-demand labor for agents in the Massive MAN.</p> <p>Aiming the Fertile Cresent such revolutionary technological objectives, I take their social and economic impact as well as safety, security, interpretability, explainability, autonomy, responsibility, and the like very seriously: by integrating a variety of past and present research and development in this project, I aim to align the world’s human and artificial intelligence with minimized economic, technical, and carbon-footprint cost, by architectuing the Massive MAN as a distributed, decentralized, democratic web service, I align the interests of diverse stakeholders towards accelerating the growth of artificial superintelligence, increase utilization efficiency of present computation resources, and mitigate problems arising from a single AI superpower; by initially adhering to a one-Limboid-per-customer rule, I slow the labor replacement problems it creates; and by performing all my research and development in the open along with actively invinting others to particapate in cultivating the Fertile Cresent, I minimize contributing to social, economic, and skill divide.</p> <p>Industry-shaping developments are ahead and AI is hanging 10. With the Fertile Cresent project of projects, I aim to integrate the intellectual labors of innumerable researchers, developers, and engineers and germinate the growth of fully autonomous artificial super-intelligence, perhaps retrospectively, a significant technological achievement in human history.</p> <p>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>Background</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;My family places strong value on learning, kindness, and integrity. My dad spent much of my childhood as a systems engineer at Microsoft, and my mom, as a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses.[^1][:(They’re still in related areas.)] Passing their values on, my siblings and I enjoyed regular visits to the library, lively conversations about science and engineering, and hours of creative play and programming with LEGO Mindstorm robots.&lt;/p&gt;</a></p> <p>I was the school nerd: making toy VB6 programs in 5th grade, spending free time in middle school designing CNC’s, robots, and other machines, and studying Calculus III during 9th grade Spanish class. To pass the time in Algebra II, I wrote a 3D rocket trajectory simulator on the school’s TI-84 calculator. While many of the seniors huddled over their calculators computing chemistry lab analyses by hand, I was the junior passing out CD’s containing my ‘Lab-a-tron’ homework helper. Although not on the normal degree plan, my school paid the community college for me to take several advanced math classes (Calculus I, II, III, and Ordinary Differential Equations) in my senior year, during which time I also organised a 43-person lab group spanning three sections of dual credit biology.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Outside school, I spent time fueling my passion for science and engineering with hours of reading, experiments, designing, and making. At various times, water electrolysis units, robotic arms, and tests tubes of fungus littered our room. After seeing the Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D printer at the age of 12, I fell in love with engineering and would often spend after-hours in the garage making sparks fly. Two years later, I (finally) discovered the programming world outside Microsoft, which in my case, started with web 1.0 programming and later included Python. After graduating, I got active in a full time ministry while working part time. Later that year, I stumbled across \verb</td> <td>arxiv.org</td> <td>, started reading the papers, and fell into the `let’s create AI’ black hole. I’m still there, and if I get to meet you, I hope to pull you in!</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>What Got You Into Ai</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;What makes it not interesting? The “thinking machine” drean has fascinated philosophers, machinists, and scientists for centuries. While there are many interpretations of the scope and focus of “artificial intelligence”, I take it to denote “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”.[^2][: as first proposed by McCarthry, who coined the term “artificial intelligence”. CITE TODO]. A definitive example would be a computer program that converses so naturally that it is impossible to distinguish the program from a human conversant. Such a program, if capable of generalizing to new problems in a similar way as humans do, would dramatically reduce the cost of intellectual capital and offer a partial solution to greese the wheels of beaurucratic machinery, thereby accelerating progress in science, technology, medicine, business, and other pillars of modern human society. However there are many more classes of problems to solve outside of language. “Artificial intelligence” is often an umbrella term for all the intellectual ‘power tools’ like programming which we humans have developed. Likely, you can identify other situations where an artificial extension to your intelligence is advantageous. I aim to make this resource available to as many as possible by informing others about and contributing to its development.&lt;/p&gt;</a></p> <p>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>Describe Your Greatest Engineering Accomplishment</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a great definition for “great” ;-), but here are some accomplishments I am especially proud of:&lt;/p&gt;</a></p> <ul> <li>The Copyright Calculator. Developing this application was one of the most involved projects of my 9th grade given the resources and skills at my disposal. At the time, I was already busy starting high school, building a 3D printer, and making Blender animations when Technology class started a 4-person group project with the focus of helping students determine whether they can reuse a third-party artifact under fair-use. I had recently learned <em>about</em> HTML, CSS, and javascript, and I could read simple web pages, but this project called for serious early morning study and coding sessions. Life was hard back then. I didn’t have autocomplete, Github CoPilot, or anything like that. And since I updated the DOM by using the ancient approach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Document.getElementById(...).innerHTML = ...</code>, I often didn’t even have syntax highlighting. There were backslashes all over the place – especailly in parts of the app where the dynamically generated HTML was being used to generate more content! However, the result was a awsome web app, not to mention a grade of 100.</li> <li>DesparadosAEye: This full-stack ML project involving <a href="https://github.com/kmosoti/DesparadosAEYE/blob/main/ConversationAIipynb.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research &amp; training</a>, presenting at UTA Innovation Day 2021, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/jacob-valdez/blenderbot-small-tflite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">porting Facebook’s blender-bot model to tflite</a> challanged every major asset I thought I had: team management, machine learning, and app development — not to mention the technical debts tackled compiling and deploying a 335-million parameter language model to the Android. I thank my teamates — Chance Huddleston, Adam Khalaf, Payton Parrish, and especially, Kennedy Mosoti — for pulling through with me. Adam and Payton worked on the login screen and app icon; Chance and Kennedy developed the core application and backend data model; and I developed the conversation interface and its ML backend. I think we all expected things to go faster than they really did. But by early April, the unknown unknowns were begining to surface. After struggling with transformer after transformer diverging and dozens of fatal ‘neural network surgery’ operations, I found the 90M BlenderBot model to be a viable network for use in our application’s conversation intelligence. After compiling, deploying, debugging, and repeating, we presented our final app on May 6, 2021, finishing with 1 hour to spare! We had developed the world’s first mobile application which, to my knowledge, uses blenderbot for on-device mobile chatting.</li> <li>Jnumpy: Jnumpy stands for Jacob’s numpy library for machine learning, and yes, it’s mainly a personal project. You see, my CSE 4308 / 4309 / 4392 classes assigned dozens of projects relating to machine learning and neural networks, and the professors often require that no unapproved third-party libraries be used (basically, anything besides numpy and python builtins). Realizing early on that this would demand rewriting a lot of code, I made the objective to develop a deep learning framework. Incrementally but steadily jnumpy evolved from a csv loader to a matrix multiplecation backpropagator to an arbitry DAG automatic differentiation solver to a full blown deep learning framework, complete with neural network and reinforcement learning abstractions. Unlike the above projects, the biggest challange here was prioritizing development work. Working without a deadline, there were many points in development where I thought ‘I want this feature or that feature’, but at the end of the day, such features didn’t bring practical value to the project when I used it for my homework, so I had to throw them in the backlog (which is basically the trash bin). I feel establishing and maintaining priorities in this project will prove useful in future seemingly never-ending projects.</li> </ul> <p>I could list several others I worked on but never completed, for example, the Cookie Baker 3D Printer, the Cookie Cutter CNC, or the MLN-Dashboard, to name a few. My limited engineering experience has impressed on me the need to 1) never turn away from work because it’s hard, boring, or unappreciated, 2) stick through low points when feedback is sparse or negative, and 3) just get started.</p> <p>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>Relate A Setback Youve Overcome</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;Getting up after my DIY’ed Cookie Cutter CNC EDM head shorted out the lab in 9th grade in front of my entire class, teacher, and principal was probably the hardest, most embarassing setback I’ve faced. I’d spent dozens of hours, written hundreds of lines of code, learned so many fundamental science and engineering concepts, and the reward was very discouraging. But I couldn’t give up on engineering — or even that project. The very next day, </a><a href="https://youtu.be/yGfpX0WXYFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I presented</a> on Cookie Cutter project and its present and planned features. Throughout the Summer, I quenched my newly ignited passion for calculus, differential equations, fluid dynamics, electricity, and material science with hundreds of textbook pages, documents, and wikipedia articles. And with similar determination, it is still my resolve to carry motivational integrity through the setbacks I face as an engineer, and more generally, as a human.&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<b>Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years</b>{“ “}&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t know! I try to take one day at a time so I can focus my energy. Currently, I hope to be deploying humanoid robots across the world by then, but whatever circumstances come, I aim for an action-oriented life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horz-card"&gt;<a href=""> <b>Common Objections To Work Involving Artificial Intelligence</b>{“ “}&lt;h2 id="artificial-intelligence-is-taking-peoples-jobs"&gt;Artificial intelligence is taking people’s jobs!&lt;/h2&gt;</a></p> <p>Yes it is. However all technology does, and a healthy job market is constantly evolving: new jobs being created and old ones consolidated. When we look back on the past 3,000 years, we appreciate the technological advances that have dramatically reduced the cost of providing essentials as food, water, clothing, and healthcare (though not to say that this margin always reaches consumers), and it can be similar with artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Understandably, as our ancestors experienced in the above cases, change is hard, especially when technological revolutions rapidly reshape the status quo. However no single person or organization is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence. We should prepare for the inevitable, and we definitely do not want to be in the dark while malicious actors are working hard to engineer such technology. By keeping my notes, code, and other project artifacts transparent, inviting others to join me on this totally volunteer initiative, and by drawing public attention to the multi-potency of artificial intelligence, I contribute to what I see as the safest, most democratic, decentralized, transparent, responsible, and benevolent possible introduction of this revolutionary technology.</p> <h2 id="artificial-intelligence-can-produce-unintended-negative-consequences">Artificial intelligence can produce unintended negative consequences.</h2> <p>Most new technology comes with unanticapated side effects, a case in point being pharmecueticals. I do not claim that my work has no negative potential or impact. That being said, people’s view of artificial intelligence is usually very different than the real thing. Often, the term “artificial intelligence” merely denotes an algorithm that is new, powerful, and not well understood, such as neural networks. As they not well understood, these algorithms can make produce outputs that cause unexpected problems. However those sorts of problems are really the system architect’s fault, and not the system itself. Computers rarely make a mistake.</p> <p>Science fiction and popular statements often echo the experiment-gone-wrong motif as follows: a ‘critical mass’ of software complexity suddenly explodes into a mythologically inspired Artificial Super-Intelligence. It turns evil, breaks out of the lab, and takes over the world. What people rarely get to hear is that we haven’t found such a mythologically-inspired algorithm even after seven decades of searching, and it takes a lot of engineering to make agents that act with any awareness of morality — good or bad. Even if an agent did make an unanticapated off-the-charts leap in intelligence while given unsupervised access to the Internet or a robot, my understanding is that its objectives would not necesarily change. If it displayed a benevolent ‘personality’ prior to the change, then it would continue following such. Of course, its already a very bad idea to deploy an untested, unsupervised controller on a production system to begin with. The Massive MAN mitigates this issue by virtue of its distributed, decentralized, transparent, and democratic nature. Rapid runaway growth must occur simultaneously on many agents for an unrivaled Massive Mutli-Agent subNetwork superpower to emerge. Provided agents occupy diverse niches, this seems unlikely.</p> <p>There is however valid reason to be wary of the gradual centralization of such AI resources. It may be an invisible hand rather than any particular human, algorithm, or organization that aligns many of the Massive MAN’s stakeholder’s interests too perfectly for its origonally transparent, democratic ideal to hold. In the hands of a few corperate superpowers, it might be too easy for the Massive MAN to serve not-so-benevolent ends. Careful monitoring, diligent research, an involved community, and an informed public provide strong countermeasure to mitigate such dangerous outcomes.</p> <h2 id="your-research-empowers-people-to-hurt-manipulate-and-exploit-others">Your research empowers people to hurt, manipulate, and exploit others!</h2> <p>It makes me sad to think about how people are always trying to hurt each other, regardless of the technology at their disposal for doing so. Artificial intelligence is no exception. It is an essential technology to lethal autonomous weapons systems, aka, “slaughterbots” or “killer robots. Poorly trained face classification systems perpetuate racial bias. Deepfake generators can be used to synthesize extremely deceptive propaganda or slander people. Recommender systems empower advertisers to make highly targeted marketing efforts, convincing people to buy things they really do not need, never wanted, and don’t have money to buy. Developments in artificial intelligence place strain on the labor markets as it replaces jobs faster than they are created. Inequality already experienced, such as in the Global South, grows further, especially when the poor are exploited as underpaid information workers to feed data-hungry machine learning algorithms.</p> <p>That being said, not all research and development in artificial intelligence have objectionable intent. Artificial intelligence has made many positive industrial, social, and economic contributions to humankind such as automating quality control processes, driving therepuetic and surgical robots, translating between hundreds of languages, and accelerating healthcare diagnoses. It’s the electricity of the 21st century. Across many industries, artificial intelligence complements, rather than replaces, human labor, reducing human error, increasing reliability and safety, and automating repetitive processes. It is not a substitute for human intelligence, but just another useful tool in our intellectual toolkit.</p> <p>Thus I personally do not consider generic artificial intelligence research as wrong. While both I and clever marketers make use of this technology and even contribute to its development, my purpose is not to support personally objectionable use cases, just as the average economic agent inescapably supports others, however far-fetched or unrelated, by merely particapating in their economy. After making reasonable, conscientious efforts to mitigate undesirable application, I am no longer responsible for the misuse of my research and developments. However I understand that others have different perspectives on this very sensitive topic and do not force my views on anyone.</p> <h2 id="whats-intelligent-about-ai">What’s “intelligent” about AI?</h2> <p>It seems everyone has their own definition for “intelligence”. I’m never satisfied with any single one. Nonetheless, I’m sure we can both pick out human and animal behaviors that we consider examples of intelligence.
