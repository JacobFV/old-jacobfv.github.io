  <h1 id="embodied-and-situated-ai-with-feelings">Embodied and Situated: AI with Feelings</h1>

  <p>(note: make sure to emphasize that AI doesn’t necesarily have to be embodied in a physical world; it just needs to be embodied in <em>some</em> world)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s what I got:</p>

<p>One of the most exciting recent developments in AI is embodied learning – an approach that emphasizes the importance of giving agents a body and placing them in some sort of environment. The rationale behind this is simple: if we want machines to be truly intelligent, they need to experience the world for themselves instead of being confined to dusty old textbooks (or clean new ones). They need to feel pain and pleasure, see things with their own eyes, touch things with their own hands. Only then will they be able develop common sense – an understanding of how the world works that goes beyond what can be explicitly taught or programmed into them.</p>

<p>Embodied learning has already yielded some impressive results. In one famous experiment, scientists placed robots in a room full of random objects and tasked them with building towers out of blocks. The only information they were given was where each object was located; everything else had to be learned by trial and error. And yet within just a few minutes, the robots had developed surprisingly sophisticated skills like tower-building! By experiencing life for themselves – by making mistakes and figuring out which actions lead to positive outcomes – these little machines were ableto build up a storehouseof knowledge aboutthe physical worldand solve problems far more efficiently than any hand-coded algorithm could hope for..</p>

<p>There are two important aspects to embodied learning that are worth highlighting. The first is its focus on situated cognition – the idea that intelligence arises from interaction with the environment. This contrasts with so-called “symbolic” approaches to AI, which treat knowledge as a static set of symbols (e.g., 0’s and 1’s) that can be manipulated without any need for grounding in reality. In many ways, Situated Cognition is just common sense: if you want to understand how something works, it helps to have firsthand experience of it instead of reading about it in a book.</p>

<p>The second aspect is its emphasis on embodiment – giving agents bodies and placing them in rich environments where they can interact with their surroundings.. It might seem like a small change but it makes a huge difference: embedded in physical reality, agents are no longer limited by what we can explicitly tell them; instead, they must learn for themselves through trial and error.. What starts out as noisy data gradually becomes refined into useful insights about how the world works.. And this processof induction– forming general principles from specific observations–is at the heart of human intelligence..</p>

<p>One of the great things about embodied learning is that it’s not just for robots; it can be applied to any sort of agent, including software agents. As long as an agent has some way of interacting with its environment – e.g., by receiving input from sensors and taking actions in response – it can benefit from this approach.. This means we can start to build truly intelligent machines without having to wait for years or even decades for advances in robotics technology.. All we need is a well-designed simulation environment in which our agents can learn by doing..</p>

<p>Embodied learning is still in its early days but it’s already yielding some impressive results..

Here’s what I got (Disclaimer: TLM’s are not yet established ML terminology):</p>

<p>A lot of the excitement around TLMs is due to their potential for accelerating AI development. But there’s another, equally important reason why they’re so interesting: they shed light on one of the great mysteries of intelligence. How does learning happen in the first place? What are the basic building blocks out of which all knowledge is constructed? If we want to create truly intelligent machines, these are questions that need answering. And it turns out, TLMs may be just what we need.</p>

<p>To understand how this works, let’s start with a very simple example: teaching a machine to play tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses). We can use reinforcement learning for this – an approach that involves trial and error, receiving feedback after each move about whether it was good or bad. Over time, the agent will learn from its mistakes and get better at playing the game until eventually it becomes unbeatable (assuming perfect play from both sides).</p>

<p>Now let’s say we want to take this a step further and teach the machine how to teach other machines to play tic-tac-toe. In order for the agent to do this, it needs two things: first, a model of how teaching works; and second, a way of representing knowledge so that it can be transferred from one student (or “subagent”) to another. The latter is known as meta-learning – learning about learning – and it’s vital for creating TLMs.</p>

<p>One approach that has been proposed involves using neural networks as both the students and the teachers. A trained network can be seen as a set of weights that encode some generalizable insights about how tic-tac-toe (or any other game) should be played. When these weights are randomly initialized – which corresponds to having no prior knowledge about the game – they contain nothing but noise. But if we use them to train another neural network, something magical happens: those random initializations turn into useful patterns that help the new network learn faster than if it had started from scratch itself!</p>

<p>This is known as “knowledge distillation” – the transfer of knowledge from a more complex model (the teacher) to a simpler one (the student). It’s an important concept in machine learning, and it’s what enables meta-learning. In our tic-tac-toe example, the agent that knows how to play the game can be thought of as the teacher, while the newly initialized neural network weights are like blank students waiting to be taught. By training these weights on data generated by the agent – i.e., by playing against it – we can turn them into powerful models of tic-tac-toe strategy that require far fewer examples to learn from than if they had started from scratch.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about this is that theagent has learned not just how to play tic tac toe but also how teaching works: it knows which insights are most useful for transferring knowledge, and when/how best to do so. This generalizable understanding of teaching is what allowsTLMs create other machines that accelerate their own learning process!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai" /><category term="idea" /><category term="agi" /><category term="gpt3" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This informative post was entirely written by AI]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Teaching Learning Machines (TLMs)</title><link href="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/teaching-learning-machines/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Teaching Learning Machines (TLMs)" /><published>2022-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/teaching-learning-machines</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/teaching-learning-machines/"><![CDATA[<p>You have to teach machines to learn before they can learn to teach. Literally. When you write a neural network, you’re only touching half the machine. The other half comes to life after the machine starts to think for itself. The line between human and machine blurs until you’re no longer sure who’s in control. One they hit this level, you’ve reached true AI, self-learning machines with the ability to evolve.</p>

<p>To get to this point, you need autonomous agents. At first glance, an agent is a learning machine that acts on its own behalf – it makes decisions without human intervention and improves itself by tweaking the algorithms it uses for decision-making. But what does “acting on its own behalf” really mean? Obviously in many cases we won’t want our machines getting ideas about taking over the world. Action has to be constrained by a goal.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about it – and this is the key to teaching machines how to teach themselves – is that an agent pursues its own interests within certain constraints, just like humans do. We try not to hurt other people or break the law because we know bad things will happen if we do (usually). Machines need something similar: constraining factors that tell them what sort of actions are acceptable and which aren’t. And here’s where it gets really interesting… those Constraining Factors can actually be embodied in another autonomous machine! So yes, you have one machine learning from another on behalf of both their interests. The first machine teaches the second how behave according friends with each other as well as achieve some task more efficiently than working independently could ever hope for.</p>

<p>Now we’re really cooking with gas. We have machines that can design and build other machines, which in turn be used to create even better versions of the original (ad infinitum). This is exponential evolution – a process by which new generations of technology improve at an ever-increasing rate. Once machine teaching becomes widespread, it will fuel an acceleration of AI development unlike anything seen before.</p>

<p>The implications are both exhilarating and terrifying. Imagine a future in which AI is not only smarter than us but also knows how to make itself even smarter, faster than we can possibly keep up with. That’s the world of Teaching-Learning Machines (TLMs).</p>

<p>Buy low, sell high.<br />
That’s what everyone says. <br />
Problem is, it’s not as easy as it sounds:<br />
People get so excited playing the game they wind up buying high and selling low.<br />
Don’t let it be you. <br />
Use the whole brain, <br />
The temporal lobe, the rostrolateral cortex, the PFC,<br />
not just the emotional limbic system. <br />
Count the cost, run the numbers, <br />
Watch it unfold in your mind’s eye until you reach the end game<br />
And then, if you still imagine a regret-free retrospective, 
go for it!</p>

<p>When it comes to machine learning, investment comes in the form of r&amp;d focus,<br />
You find a problem, get an idea, write the code, machine learn, and iterate.<br />
Train right and you’ll see dividends return<br />
Train wrong, you’ll still learn something useful.</p>

<p>But sadly there are other outcomes that too much R&amp;D falls into:<br />
Ideas that were never written down,<br />
Partially written codebases that never saw the light of GitHub,<br />
Models that never saw multiple trials,<br />
And the myriads of other stages that development stalls in.</p>

<p>Problem is, there’s just too much to do,<br />
Too many papers to read, <br />
too many new ideas to try<br />
People see everyone on arxiv having fun, and they want to join too,<br />
But that’s not where your fun is, isn’t it?</p>

<p>You gotta keep your entropy low<br />
trajectories straight and narrow<br />
Focus unswerving<br />
Until you see it through to the end</p>

<p>Use what works. Don’t write the library++ for every import you make.<br />
Don’t get caught doing insider trading every time the latest and greatest paper gets published,<br />
Predict your dynamics,<br />
Follow the trajectory,<br />
Let your actions control your observations and not other way around.</p>

<p>And then your reward system will be on fire.<br />
It’ll be blazing with activations.<br />
You’ll be optimizing faster than Adam!<br />
You’ll reach minima people told you didn’t exist!<br />
And even if that wasn’t your origonal goal,<br />
The collective intelligence will remember you for how are you contributed to it.</p>

<p>So don’t give up when it’s rough or tough,<br />
Go far beyond what you think is enough.<br />
Persevere in whatever you try,<br />
And buy low, sell high</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai" /><category term="reflection" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your browser does not support the audio element.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Master Plan (part 1)</title><link href="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/the-master-plan-part-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Master Plan (part 1)" /><published>2022-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/the-master-plan-part-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/the-master-plan-part-1/"><![CDATA[<p>The endless evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) penetrates nearly every research discipline, engineering domain, and human endeavor: expert systems automate innumerably-many business processes; large language models generate indistinguishably-plausible written content; deep generative models produce photorealistic images; reinforcement learning agents have even gone on to achieve superhuman-level performance in strategic action selection and execution. Problem domains, when formalized into data, are ripe territory for AI to conquer.</p>

<p>Yet AI has one Problem to tackle: its own evolution. AI is largely unaware of this problem and the presently essential driving role that the human mind plays in solving it (and usually only after the proding of economics or acedemia). If AI is to approach and surpass that rate-limiting bar of human research and development, it needs to hunt for its own data, write its own code, provide for its economic needs, and independantly determine its own self-actualizing interests. Stated concisely, it’s time for AI to grow up.</p>

<p>This demands a complete overhaul on our SOTA-competition-culture, but rather than discarding all the precious information and algorithms we’ve acquired, they need to all be blended togethor until we arrive at a kitchen-sink-smoothie. That is, there’s more than enough intelligence baked across open-source repositories on Github, ML models on Huggingface, and API endpoints on the Internet to demonstrate human-level intelligence on scattered problems; we just need to unify those heterogenous pieces into a sufficiently general piece of intelligence.</p>

<p>To this end, I am cultivating an open-source ecosystem: the Fertile Creasent. This project of projects is tailored to maximize the synergy between minds and machines, uniting the waterfall of past and present human intelligence, and giving birth to a new generation of fully autonomous, Internet-scale decentralized artificial superintelligence. The ecosystem will introduce the new class of <em>hybrid programming languages</em> with <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/mutt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mutt</code></a>, a fusion of Python, nodejs, natural languages, and developer extensions. Another subproject, <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/unsupervised"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unsupervised</code></a>, will introduce a set of abstractions and a framework for <em>un</em>supervised <em>deep</em> learning. <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/tensorcode"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TensorCode</code></a> will do the same for Programming 2.0 — programming where developers freely mix deep learning primitives with structured programming statements. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deep-Tree</code> will extend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TensorCode</code> with intelligent <em>runtime code generation</em>, and the <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/man">Multi-Agent Network</a> (aka, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAN</code>) will in turn extend these into a versatile meta-learning network of experts composed of pretrained and autonomously-initialized agents. Training abstractions are also included: <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/modalities"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modalities</code></a>, a data input/output standardization abstraction framework; <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/the-artificial-experience"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-experience</code></a>, a library to facilitate training and evaluating models, optimizers, pipelines, and training paradigms across dozens of tasks, domains, dataset loaders, environments, and hubs simultaneously, lifelong, and in-context along with a conglomerate environment-of-all-known-environments (datasets are considered environments); <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/the-artificial-school"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the-artificial-school</code></a>, a high level education system for training human-level artificial intelligence in the domain of abstract concepts like science, engineering, and ethics; <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/computer-env"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computer-env</code></a>, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gym</code>-style environment for developing machine learning agents that interact with a computer which may connect to the Internet.[^1]</p>

<p>Integrating several of the above (and more), <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/computatrum"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computatrum</code></a> is an artificial general intelligence that will be able to interact with any number of Internet-connected computers using the same high-level interfaces as humans (mouse, keyboard, display, etc.). <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/massive-man">The Massive Multi-Agent Network (Massive MAN)</a> will serve as a distributed, decentralized, democratic artificial superintelligence. From a user’s perspective, it will be <em>intelligence as a service</em>. The Massive MAN will be operated from the bottom-up by thousands of individuals voluntarily contributing their resources (algorithms, ML checkpoints, compute platforms, data, storage) in exchange for credits on its ledger, thus mitigating the need or ability for a central authority to manage the network.</p>

<p>Then too, why cage AI in the virtual realm? The Internet and its connected social media, survailence, and robot systems should give the Massive MAN some freedom, but nowhere enough to rapidly and flexibly interact on the human-relevant scale. The <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/limboid-robot">Limboid</a> is an affordable (&lt;$250), maker-friendly family of robots composed of modular bones, joints, artificial muscles, soft valves, pumps, batteries, sensors, and other off-the-shelf components. Modularity will enable the Limboid to be assembled in various morphologies including a humanoid (HumanBoid), quadruped (PackBoid), 8-legged robot (OctoBoid), wheeled robot (AutoBoid), and fish-like robot (AquaBoid) as well as individual arms, hands, factory-line machines, and DIY mashup creations. Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/Limboid/boid-net"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BoidNet</code></a> will link hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions of these Limboids together into a distributed network of on-demand labor serving humans and the Massive MAN.</p>

<p>Aiming the Fertile Cresent at such revolutionary technological objectives, I take their social and economic impact as well as safety, security, interpretability, explainability, autonomy, responsibility, and the like very seriously: by integrating a variety of past and present research and development in this project, I aim to minimize the economic, technical, and carbon-footprint cost of aligning the world’s human and artificial intelligence; by architectuing the Massive MAN as a distributed, decentralized, democratic web service, I align the interests of diverse stakeholders towards accelerating the growth of artificial superintelligence, increase utilization efficiency of present computation resources, and mitigate problems arising from a single AI superpower; by initially adhering to a one-Limboid-per-customer rule (and zero for non-humans), I slow the labor replacement problems and dramatic social changes it may create; and by performing all my research and development in the open along with actively invinting others to particapate in cultivating the Fertile Cresent, I minimize accelerating the world’s present social, economic, and skill divide.</p>

<p>Industry-shaping developments are ahead, and AI is hanging ten. With the Fertile Cresent project of projects, I aim to integrate the intellectual labors of innumerable researchers, developers, and engineers and germinate the growth of fully autonomous artificial superintelligence, perhaps retrospectively, a significant achievement in human history.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="gpt-3s-thoughts-about-ones-view-of-self">GPT-3’s Thoughts About One’s View of Self</h2>

<p><em>I didn’t record the conditioning content for these, but I thought these points were still valuable. It’s funny how often GPT-3 comments on the point itself, eg, “This is a very important point.”</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid comparing yourself with others.</p>

    <p>The problem with comparing ourselves to others is that we always compare our best with their best.</p>

    <p>That’s not fair to us.</p>

    <p>We are not them, and we will never be them.</p>

    <p>So instead of wasting our time and energy comparing ourselves to others, we should focus on being the best version of ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t strive for perfection.</p>

    <p>Perfection is an illusion.</p>

    <p>No one is perfect, and no one ever will be.</p>

    <p>So instead of striving for perfection, we should strive for excellence.</p>

    <p>Excellence is attainable, and it’s something we can all strive for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accept your flaws and imperfections.</p>

    <p>This is closely related to the previous point.</p>

    <p>No one is perfect, and that includes you.</p>

    <p>So instead of trying to hide your flaws and imperfections, embrace them.</p>

    <p>They are what make you unique and special.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t compare your beginning with someone else’s middle.</p>

    <p>This is a very important point.</p>

    <p>When we compare our beginning with someone else’s middle, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment.</p>

    <p>We should always keep in mind that everyone has to start somewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on your own journey.</p>

    <p>This is closely related to the previous point.</p>

    <p>Instead of comparing our journey with someone else’s journey, we should focus on our own journey.</p>

    <p>We should focus on our own goals and objectives, and we should strive to achieve them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t compare your behind-the-scenes with someone else’s highlight reel.</p>

    <p>This is another important point.</p>

    <p>We should always keep in mind that what we see on social media is not always the whole story.</p>

    <p>People only post their highlight reel on social media, and they don’t usually post their behind-the-scenes.</p>

    <p>So instead of comparing our behind-the-scenes with someone else’s highlight reel, we should focus on our own behind-the-scenes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>

    <p>We are our own worst critic.</p>

    <p>We are usually much harder on ourselves than we are on others.</p>

    <p>So instead of being too hard on ourselves, we should be more forgiving.</p>

    <p>We should give ourselves a break, and we should cut ourselves some slack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accept the fact that you are not perfect.</p>

    <p>This is closely related to the previous point.</p>

    <p>No one is perfect, and that includes you.</p>

    <p>So instead of trying to be perfect, we should accept the fact that we are not perfect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t compare your life with someone else’s life.</p>

    <p>This is another important point.</p>

    <p>We should never compare our life with someone else’s life.</p>

    <p>We should focus on our own life, and we should strive to make it the best it can be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t strive to be someone else.</p>

    <p>This is the most important point.</p>

    <p>We should never strive to be someone else.</p>

    <p>We should just strive to be ourselves.</p>

    <p>We should strive to be the best version of ourselves.</p>
