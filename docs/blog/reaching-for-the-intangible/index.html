  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I wrote the following comment after conversing with a researcher at the University of Texas at Arlington:</p>

<p>Exactly how intelligent would you say humans are? With Hunter and Legg‚Äôs
definition of intelligence as the ability to achieve a wide range of
goals in many environments, it‚Äôs safe to say that humans are highly
intelligent in comparison to all other observed goal-seeking systems. In
fact, it is extremely difficult to identify goals they cannot seek
within the framework of our universe. However, unreachable goals do
‚Äòexist‚Äô as identified by Godel‚Äôs incompleteness theorems and Turing‚Äôs
halting problem. Those formal proofs established the unprovability,
undecidability, and intractability of their decade- and century-long
problem domains, and their eager or reluctant acceptance optimized the
ambitions of the mathematical and computational science research that
followed.</p>

<p>I see certain fields of AI today reaching for a similarly intangible
goal: human-level artificial intelligence. You see, ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô AI
research often begins with the speculation: ‚ÄúI see that human
intelligence uniquely does this or that, so if I make an AI system with
those features, it must be ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô artificial intelligence.‚Äù
Consider three examples of this thinking in action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Turing @turing_1950 proposed the Imitation game as a discriminative
test of humanly-indistinguishable machine ‚Äúthinking‚Äù.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄòWhat will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
game?‚Äô Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game
is played like this [between a machine and a woman] as he does
when the game is played between a man and a woman? [‚Ä¶] The
question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing
almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to
include.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nilsson @Nilsson_2005 proposes the employment test as identifying a
the fractional degree of progress towards human-level AI:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To pass the employment test, AI programs must be able to perform
the jobs ordinarily performed by humans. Progress toward
human-level AI could then be measured by the fraction of these
jobs that can be acceptably performed by machines</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You @park2021definition propose the language acquisition test:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We conjecture that learning from others‚Äô experience with the
language is the essential characteristic that distinguishes human
intelligence from the rest. Humans can update the action-value
function with the verbal description as if they experience states,
actions, and corresponding rewards sequences firsthand.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While these theses provide concrete measures which are useful feedback
signals to compare AI, I find them insufficient to fully define the
meaning of ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô intelligence. It is now common to read
statements from gpt3 and other large language models that pass our
subjective ‚ÄòTuring test‚Äô. The employment test is probably the most
general of the above three measures of human-level AI since it
intrinsically demands few-shot on-the-job learning, but AI evolution is
a slow feedback signal and better suited as an auxiliary dev metric than
a primary optimization objective. We would may end up discovering the
divergence between working-human intelligence and unemployed human
intelligence by the time that benchmark approaches 100%. Finally, the
language acquisition test is trivially solved by only reducing the
parametric complexity of the ‚Äúaction-value function‚Äù. Learned optimizers
have already been shown capable of optimizing themselves @metz2020tasks
[@metz2021training], and in the language of reinforcement learning, you
might say that they update their own action-value function. With various
definitions of ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù, multi-agent reinforcement learning has also
identified language emergence, acquisition, and guidance in
feedback-driven environments, and as unsupervised, self-supervised, and
intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning research progresses, we
should soon be seeing the same results without feedback. However, rather
than suggesting that the integration of self-optimizing learned
optimizers, MARL environments, and reward-free training paradigms are
guaranteed to converge at positively ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô artificial
intelligence, I would only estimate that they will exhibit <em>more</em>
complex, diverse, open-ended behaviors than previous architectures.</p>

<p>Those are just three examples where pivotal components of ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô
intelligence are accentuated as if they defined it. Even the brain as a
whole is often exalted too high above its underlying physiological world
interface and environmental interaction experience. These other two
players guide the development of the brain and the intelligence it
expresses. Reciprocally, the brain acts as a forcing function to
maintain order over its body and interact in its environment. The body
and environment play key roles in grounding the brain‚Äôs internal
oscillations into metaphors of cognition, and without all three, there
is no human-level intelligence. Individuals raised in stimulation-poor
environments or who have underlying physiological limitations, show
statistically diminished potential in cultivating intelligence.</p>

<p>There are many other examples where an average AI researcher‚Äôs prior on
‚Äúhuman-level‚Äù artificial intelligence diverges from the real deal, and I
hypothesize those seemingly sparse cases are actually uncountable. As
with physics‚Äôs models, the brain has been subjected to numerous
comparisons over the ages including the oscillator, the clock, the steam
engine, the formal proof machine, the computer, and even the neural
network. However neuroscience continually reminds us that the Brain is
something else, and while we AI researchers may surpass it in various
complexity, accuracy, and recall metrics, we‚Äôre still not capturing its
‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô intelligence.</p>

<p>These thoughts are not new, and even researchers in the field of human
level artificial intelligence acknowledge them. They may justify their
use of the term ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô as a means to communicate their objective
to non-specialists - including committee boards, funding agencies, and
executives. However, I argue that this is where the term may be abused
in its worst. We scientists recognize the nuances and history underlying
our terminology, so we are often able to afford the use of ambiguous
terms like ‚Äòthinking‚Äô, ‚Äòattention‚Äô, and ‚Äòperception‚Äô to describe the
activity occurring in the brain or artificial neural network. I probably
have a good idea of what you‚Äôre reaching for when you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
developing a human-level AI system‚Äù. However, when the term is taken out
of context, a person may be introduced to human-level AI with the idea
that it should do <em>everything</em> a real human intelligence can. Of course
the realistic engineer expects to find flaws in his artificial system
and eagerly looks for them, but when a funding agency, review board, or
the general public are surprised by those same discrepancies, they are
not amused. Funding for everybody gets cut; public interest declines;
and the anticipation built up for ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô artificial intelligence
has been abused. If you want to help AI continue to evolve and avoid a
third AI winter, don‚Äôt use the buzzword ‚Äúhuman-level‚Äù to describe your
artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>I see two paradigms driving the advancement of artificial intelligence.
The first uses natural language and philosophy to observe and reason on
intelligence. It says, ‚ÄúIntelligence involves a collection of discrete
processes like attention, perception, memory, etc. Let me axiom-atize
them into components and algorithms and watch intelligence to emerge.‚Äù
The latter paradigm acknowledges that biological systems consist of a
heterogeneous set of mechanisms to achieve their goals, but it cannot
express itself in natural language. Instead it uses formal descriptions,
statistical tools, and algorithms to describe intelligence. Both involve
programming and experimentation. However the flow of information from
observation to next iteration parameters must bounce around through a
noisy natural language channel in the first paradigm, while seamlessly
optimizing via pen and computer in the second paradigm. The latter
approach can be intimidating for its abstract and endless complexity.
However the former demands even more caution for it borders on a
‚Äòcargo-cult‚Äô style of intelligence engineering. By that, I mean:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the South Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people. During the war they
saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same
thing to happen now. So they‚Äôve arranged to make things like runways,
to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for
a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones
and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas‚Äîhe‚Äôs the controller‚Äîand
they wait for the airplanes to land. They‚Äôre doing everything right.
The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it
doesn‚Äôt work. No airplanes land. So I call these things Cargo Cult
Science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of
scientific investigation, but they‚Äôre missing something essential,
because the planes don‚Äôt land.@feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, this would be a blunder when aiming to extract the principles
underpinning human intelligence and engineer them into a artificial
system. Admittedly, both paradigms mentioned above represent extremes
between which most machine learning research sits somewhere in the
middle. However, as we develop increasingly advanced artificial systems,
it becomes increasingly necessary to acquire and utilize a more
mathematical oriented framework of intelligence ‚Äì instead of speaking
about philosophically-defined axioms of thought and components of
intelligence. When the time comes to program a ‚Äúthinking machine‚Äù, there
are off-the-shelf <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perceive(observation)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decide(thoughts)</code>, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attention</code> functions. On the other hand, shuttling mathematical
statements and statistical reports between the computer and brain is a
much more straightforward task, and we can render their aims into
precisely-defined building blocks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entropy</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutual_information</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">free_energy</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perplexity</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">criticality</code>.</p>

<p>It should be clear to AI researchers who sit closer to the former
extreme that advancing the intellectual capacity of artificial systems
demands acquiring a basic understanding of the mathematical and
statistical tools used to represent real intelligence ‚Äì and not just be
content with applying one or two in his or her research ‚Äì but like
brain‚Äôs predictive model ensemble, I encourage the active-learning agent
who operates in research space to entertain as many principles of human
intelligence as possible. Please consider starting with the following
(listed in the order you may find easiest to grasp):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Action and Perception as Divergence Minimization
@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-01791</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Friston‚Äôs Free Energy Principle (I recommend @friston_2009, but you
may have already found a different paper on this topic.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Energy Homeostasis Principle
@vergara_jaramillo-riveri_luarte_mo√´nne-loccoz_fuentes_couve_maldonado_2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Critical Brain Hypothesis @10.3389/fnsys.2014.00166
[@Shew15595; @Chialvo_2010]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buzs√°ki‚Äôs neural syntax hypothesis @buzs√°ki_2010</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once human-level AI researchers acquire a differentiable framework to
propagate their thoughts through the research community, vague terms
like ‚Äòhuman-level‚Äô, ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô, and ‚Äòattention‚Äô are unnecessary and
actually get in the way of progress. Instead research may be defined in
the language of neuroscience, psychology, information theory, computer
science, or entirely new machine learning vocabulary. I personally
advocate paper titles as ‚ÄúTowards Autonomous Developmental
Language-Acquiring Artificial Intelligence‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúTowards Human
Level Artificial Intelligence‚Äù. If you make the former your grant
proposal, you will almost certainly meet your objectives. However your
reward estimator diverges from mine on the latter (current) paper title.
Between you and me, these vocabulary differences are only ornamental,
and I can understand you when you say ‚Äúhuman-level‚Äù. However, I fear
these exterior word choices might cultivate paradigmatically different
mindsets and approaches to engineering artificial systems that perform
on-par with human intelligence over a wide range of goals.</p>
