## GPT-3's Thoughts About One's View of Self

*I didn't record the conditioning content for these, but I thought these points were still valuable. It's funny how often GPT-3 comments on the point itself, eg, "This is a very important point."*

1. Avoid comparing yourself with others.

    The problem with comparing ourselves to others is that we always compare our best with their best.

    That’s not fair to us.

    We are not them, and we will never be them.

    So instead of wasting our time and energy comparing ourselves to others, we should focus on being the best version of ourselves.

2. Don’t strive for perfection.

    Perfection is an illusion.

    No one is perfect, and no one ever will be.

    So instead of striving for perfection, we should strive for excellence.

    Excellence is attainable, and it’s something we can all strive for.

3. Accept your flaws and imperfections.

    This is closely related to the previous point.

    No one is perfect, and that includes you.

    So instead of trying to hide your flaws and imperfections, embrace them.

    They are what make you unique and special.

4. Don’t compare your beginning with someone else’s middle.

    This is a very important point.

    When we compare our beginning with someone else’s middle, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment.

    We should always keep in mind that everyone has to start somewhere.

5. Focus on your own journey.

    This is closely related to the previous point.

    Instead of comparing our journey with someone else’s journey, we should focus on our own journey.

    We should focus on our own goals and objectives, and we should strive to achieve them.

6. Don’t compare your behind-the-scenes with someone else’s highlight reel.

    This is another important point.

    We should always keep in mind that what we see on social media is not always the whole story.

    People only post their highlight reel on social media, and they don’t usually post their behind-the-scenes.

    So instead of comparing our behind-the-scenes with someone else’s highlight reel, we should focus on our own behind-the-scenes.

7. Don’t be too hard on yourself.

    We are our own worst critic.

    We are usually much harder on ourselves than we are on others.

    So instead of being too hard on ourselves, we should be more forgiving.

    We should give ourselves a break, and we should cut ourselves some slack.

8. Accept the fact that you are not perfect.

    This is closely related to the previous point.

    No one is perfect, and that includes you.

    So instead of trying to be perfect, we should accept the fact that we are not perfect.

9. Don’t compare your life with someone else’s life.

    This is another important point.

    We should never compare our life with someone else’s life.

    We should focus on our own life, and we should strive to make it the best it can be.

10. Don’t strive to be someone else.

    This is the most important point.

    We should never strive to be someone else.

    We should just strive to be ourselves.

    We should strive to be the best version of ourselves.
