**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Computatrum is an infrastructure for Intelligence. Think Internet 5.0. 

node neural network hyper-regularized to scale gracefully and regularized for minimal complexity (like a polynomial model that puts increasing regularization strength on higher order coefficients and so it only scales to more complex models when necesary)

nodes can be local or they can be microservices exposed by other networks. (The NNN builds on existing open source multi-device abstractions)

A decentralized pool of weights and nodes are open sourced and can be used by anyone. independant subnetworks currently communicate over the internet, but they may utilize other mechanisms in the future.

Will include
- computer interaction modalities (i.e.: mouse, keyboard, screen, audio, camera, etc.) for action and perception of unstructured data (i.e.: image search, wikipedia, twitter, etc.) 
- graph interaction modalities for leveraging structured data (i.e.: DBPedia, Freebase, personal db, etc.) This will not be heavily emphasized when critical NN's take off.

Sizes of subnetworks can be arbitrarily large. I will develop three:
computatrum-100M
computatrum-1B
computatrum-10B

All independant subnetworks
- are independant economic agents
- heavily interface with computers
- conform to the API (+graph interaction)
- are under scrutiny

clarify names for:
- global network
- independant subnetworks
- the NNN's that underlie independant subnetworks
