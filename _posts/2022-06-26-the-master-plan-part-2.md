TODO: renamae my blog post to "The dupster of all things AI"

TODO: write this post

THe previous post described a suite of technologies and ...
However its contributions are highly technical and general without any specific application
This post fleshes out a more concrete perspective of the roadmap and details some of the specific problem domains that the foregoing tools are applied towards 

- Daily/weekly programming routine
- Specific application of Computatrum:
	- writing more code
- How will the Limboid be developed?
	- schedule
- Specific applications of Limboid
	- Limboid factory services
	- Limboid humanitarian program
		- targets specific technical challenges, not general social problems
			- eg: delivering power, food, water, etc.
			- eg: providing emergency response assistance
	- Limboid space program
		- technologies: rocket, engine, fuel
		- solar network
		- lunar/martin/asteroid robotic/biological habitation
		- further targets: titan, triton, europa, pluto
		- trans-solar system expiditions
- AI Orgnizational model
	- why and how I will market these technologies
- Ensuring contributions are benevolent


Part 3:
- SynBio Engineered Limboids
- Replacing chemical/power/processing 'plants' with 'cells'
- Brain-in-a-vat and wetware supercomputer
- Digital neurons and the global BrainNet
- The Matrix

Include a discalimer that some of these may take centuries to reach
