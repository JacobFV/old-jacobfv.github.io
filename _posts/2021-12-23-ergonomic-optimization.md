description: Steps I am taking to increase my productivity
---

I don't find it easy to remain productive when I'm working at the computer (not to suggest that I am generally productive anyway). I've unintentionally conditioned myself that whenever I sit down at the computer, I need to browse the latest papers / popular repositories / system settings / etc. but not actually do the work I came to do. I'm thankful that I'm not overwhelmed with things to do anyway, but I think I could be much more productive than I currently am. I'm going to try applying the following steps for the next 8 months to increase my productivity:

1. **Establish a routine**: On Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays, I will work from 2pm to 5pm and possibly also 8am to 10am and 8pm-10pm. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I will work from 9am to 1pm and maybe later in the evening. Each day, I will also have a consistent eating, sleeping, relaxing, reading, writing, and exercise routine. I might follow this routine when I don't want to because I recognize the benefits of being in formal control. This routine should work regardless of whether school is currently on break or not.
2. **Write down my plans and _follow them_**: If I need to make a change, this should also be written before making the change. I will plan for each day in the morning and perhaps also make high level plans occasionally. Each project will have a separate planning page in my notebook. I must follow my written plans even when I don't want to do them because then I will better be able to combat distractions.
3. **Proactively fight temptations that rob me of productivity**: I love walking outdoors, running, eating, reading new papers on arxiv. None of those activities are wrong, but out of balance, they pose a challenge to productivity. I must recognize, avoid, and fight the stressors and situations that make me want to overeat, walk for hours, check the ai news, etc.

I find it hard to do things that I don't want to do, but I know I can do them. I am going to stay focused on developing the Computatrum and the Limboid, and if I can do that, I hope to have some physical accomplishments by the time I graduate, and if not, at least I will have exercised my brain to better take on the next challenge.
