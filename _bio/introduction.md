Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer, roboticist, and entreprenuer at my startup, [Limboid LLC](https://limboid.ai), where I work to develop [artificial general intelligence](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/the-master-plan-part-1/) and [affordable humanoid robots](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/the-master-plan-part-2/). During the day, I work as a software engineering intern at Motio Inc. I'm currently in a senior at the University of Texas at Arlington working towards my bachelor's degree in computer science. I love [open source work](https://github.com/JacobFV), [artificial intelligence](https://jacobfv.github.io/blog/category/ai/), and [robotics](https://jacobfvaldez.weebly.com/engineering.html). When I'm not interacting with artificial agents, you'll find me working with real people. I hope that includes you!
