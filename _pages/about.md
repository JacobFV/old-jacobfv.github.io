Hello! I'm an artificial intelligence researcher with experience in AI system design, implementation, and validation using tensorflow. During my past two years of research, I have applied AI to numerous problems with human-competitive performance in many cases. I am currently researching and developing the illusion variously identified with human-level AI, artificial general intelligence, superintelligence, ... When I'm not interacting with artificial intelligences, you'll find me speaking to real people. I hope that includes you!
