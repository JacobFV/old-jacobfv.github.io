## [Artificial Intelligence: Principle and Practice](https://jacobfv.github.io/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice/) 

**October 2021**

I am organizing a course on artificial intelligence theory and implementation. I am offering all this material free to the public and hosting it physically at UTA and live on YouTube. I hope to [have you as a student](https://jacobfv.github.io/Artificial-Intelligence-Principle-and-Practice/#signup).
