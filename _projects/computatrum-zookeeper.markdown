Computatra (pl. of Computatrum) are powerful tools for humans and themselves. However their intelligence must first be propperly introduced to and supervised by humans. Project Computatrum Zookeeper aims to help Computatra reach their full potential.

## Project Overview

### Zookeeper Server (Computatrum managed)
- Allows complete observation and control over 
    - all controlled computer environments (audio/video/mouse/keyboard/etc)
    - reading the saved weights, saved workspace states, saved MAN pickles, and other parameters
    - pause/resume the computatrum's execution
    - reading, recording, and deleting recordings of rolling histories
- Manages saving the weights, workspace states, and MAN pickles
- Maintains a rolling history of all controlled computer environments (audio/video/mouse/keyboard/etc) which can be retrospectively saved
- Provides a Zookeeper interface agent to include in the MAN which communicates text, audio, video, reward, and multimodal conversation.

### Zookeeper Client (user managed)
- React /native app: mobile, web, desktop
- Users launch, pause, hibernate, and shutdown computatra
- For each computatrum:
    - Users can interact via text, multimodal conversation, audiovideo call, and reward feedback 
    - For each controlled environment
        - App displays and allows controlling of the environment
        - Users can retrospectively record and view/share/delete recordings of the environment

### computatrum.io
- Introduces humans to this system: general public, addresses AI-safety misconceptions, how to use Computatrum
- Facilitates research and development: tutorials, documentation, code, and weights
- Showcases real-world uses of Computatra and hosts a gallery
- Hosts limited public computatra (including the computatrum family) free and allow paid private hosting
- Includes a hate page where community can vote to shutdown individual public computatra.
