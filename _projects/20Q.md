This was software engineering group project where I collaborated with Mohammed Alam, Arwa Jafferji, and Manish Phuyal to develop an Android app written in Java and Kotlin. 20 Questions is a game where the user sequentially answers yes/no questions and the app attempts to guess what the user is thinking. You can download the APK [here](https://github.com/JacobFV/20Questions/blob/main/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk) to play it yourself. Following is the presentation we gave at the end of the semester about our work:
